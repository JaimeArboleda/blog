This is my blog about data science, statistics, machine learning and other related (mostly) topics.\nI decided to start this blog thanks to the wonderful tool developed by RStudio called Quarto, that makes it easier than ever to pack a bunch of scripts into a blog.\nI won’t post very often, and many of my posts will have an educative content that I will create for myself (for my future self), but that I think could be of interest of other people, so I think that making them public is helpful.\nIf you find here something interesting, don’t hesitate to say it and leave a comment. :smile:"
