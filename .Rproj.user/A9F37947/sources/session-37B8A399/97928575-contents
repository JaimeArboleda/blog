## A data science blog

![image](welcome.png)

Hi! This is my blog about data science, statistics, machine learning and other related (mostly) topics. 

I decided to start this blog thanks to the wonderful tool developed by RStudio called Quarto, that makes it easier than ever to pack a bunch of scripts into a blog. 

I won't post very often, and many of my posts will have an educative content that I will create for myself (for my future self), but that I think could be of interest of other people, so I think that making them public is helpful. 

If you find here something interesting, don't hesitate to say it and leave a comment.
